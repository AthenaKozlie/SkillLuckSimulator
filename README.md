The following code helps get to the bottom of what it takes to be "SUCCESSFUL".

SKILL: The ability gained over a period of time that allows for an individual to become better at a certain ask. 
It is also important that this ability comes with ONLY the efforts of the individual and nothing out of the individual’s control.

LUCK: The ability gained through non-sequitur manor and or completely out of the individual's control. 
This could include many things such as where the person was born, who they meet in life, who they play against in a competition, 
their current life situation, stresses, and comfort, age, certain health issues such as type-1 diabetes (or even type 2 in a lot of cases), 
autism, depression, ADHD, schizophrenia, memory problems, surgeries, and or other injuries and disorders. All of these contribute to LUCK 
in some fashion but there are many more things I could have listed here, these are just a few. Because it is hard to pinpoint how important 
LUCK is in SUCCESS, I will try and be as conservative with my experiments and research.

SUCCESS: The driving force behind learning a SKILL. SUCCESS can mean a lot of things in different contexts, but a simple, objective, measure
I can use is a simple threshold. If someone would like to be better than x% of participants in the SKILL, then I can simply use that percentage 
as a starting point for defining SUCCESS. This also helps cover cases where people might say “SUCCESS to me is just enjoying the activity!” 
Statements like these are not only conducive to data research means because of their subjectiveness, it also provides a variable that can be 
moved around to make that person feel that they have accomplished their goal. This might sound blunt, but when trying to become SUCCESSFUL at 
a SKILL a person has chosen, the person needs to be specific with their goals. With all that said, the simple measure I will use for SUCCESS is 
a threshold. This can mean any of the following and I will be sure to specify which I mean within context: the person in question is better than 
a specified percentage of the population, the person has achieved an overall score that they have set for themselves. An example of these for 
juggling would be “I would like to be able to juggle 3 balls longer than 99% of people”. Another example for the set score method would be 
“I would like to be able to juggle 3 balls longer than 30 seconds”.
